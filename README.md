#Proposed flow
1. Open website (maajanbu-aachen.de/tracking)
2. Start new game
  * Select players from pre-defined list (in ESWN order)
  * Optionally, add a new player
  * This automatically starts a timer
3. Changes to screen with a timer and 5 buttons (and running point totals?)
  * Pause timer (changes to resume timer when pressed)
  * Ryuukyoku (exhaustive)
    * After pressing, select all tenpai players and press Done -> changes to screen 3
  * Ryuukyoku (other)
    * Choose between possible ryuukyokus (whatever we have in the rules) and "triggering" player, then press Done -> changes to screen 3
    * [Optional] box with number of oya's discards 
  * Win, when pressed new screen:
    * Select (first) winner
    * All yaku, pressable
    * Box for fu value
    * Box for dora number
    * Ron/tsumo selector
    * If ron: select who got ron'd
    * If ron: optionally press "another" if there's been more than one ron, otherwise press done
    * When done is pressed, change to screen 3
  * Abort (cancels whole game)

#Questions
* Password protect? Only parts?
* How to group/sort yaku?
* What data to display?
